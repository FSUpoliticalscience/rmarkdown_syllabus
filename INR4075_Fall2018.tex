\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

For the course description: This course introduces the student to the
philosophical and legal foundations of the international human rights
regime and explores the developments of norms and institutions with
special emphasis on the post-World War II era.

In this course, students are introduced to the international human
rights regime and explores the states responsibility to protect these
rights. The course is structured to examine, who violates human rights,
why these states violate human rights, and how the domestic governments
and international organizations improve human rights standards
throughout the world.

By the end of the course students will complete the following
objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explain the conceptual and historical evolution of the international
  human rights regime, and understand the empirical regularities of
  human rights violations across time and space.
\item
  Summarize academic theories about the incentives states face to
  violate human rights and to create domestic and international
  institutions protecting the rights of individuals, and determine
  whether empirical evidence supports or falsifies those theories.
\item
  Make policy recommendations regarding the protection of human rights
  based on theory and empirical evidence, and communicate those
  recommendations orally and in writing.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{required-readings}{%
\section{Required Readings}\label{required-readings}}

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will
discuss a variety of readings from academic journals and excerpts from
various textbooks. You are expected to do the assigned reading
\emph{before} class. Daily reading assignments are listed on the
syllabus and can be found on the canvas course page. I will notify you
of any changes to the reading in class or by university email.

In some of the articles you will read,the methods used will be entirely
new to you. I do not expect you to familiarize yourself or understand
all the methodological tools used in the readings. Instead, it is my
hope that through readings and lecture, you will have the tools
necessary to understand, evaluate, and criticize the authors' arguments.

\hypertarget{course-evaluations}{%
\section{Course Evaluations}\label{course-evaluations}}

Your grade is a weighted average of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Midterm Exam (20\%) - 100 points
\item
  Final Exam (20\%) - 100 points
\item
  Assignments (40\%) - 200 points (5 Assignments-40 points each)
\item
  Quizzes/In-class Assignments (20\%) - 100 points (10 quizzes - 10
  points each)
\end{itemize}

The grading scale for this class is as follows:

\begin{table}[h] \centering
\begin{tabular}{l  r | l r | l r   } 
Grade & Percentage  & Grade & Percentage & Grade & Percentage  \\  \hline
   &    & A     & 100 - 93\%  & A-    & 92 - 90\%   \\ 
B+    & 89 - 87\% &   B     & 86 - 83\% &   B-    & 82 - 80\%   \\  
C+    & 79 - 77\%   & C     & 76 - 73\%  & C-    & 72 - 70\%  \\ 
D+    & 69 - 67\%   & D     & 66 - 63\%   & D-    & 62 - 60\%  \\
&& F     & 59 - 0\%   &&\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\subsection{Exams}\label{exams}}

All students will take two exams (midterm and final), consisting of a
combination of multiple choice and short-answer questions. The exams
will be based on class lectures, assigned readings, and class
discussion.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Midterm Exam:
\item
  Final Exam:
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\subsection{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

You will complete five assignments for this course. Each assignment is
based on applying the theories from class and the readings to a real
world example. Each assignment is worth 40 points. Late assignments
receive 5 points off (one letter grade) for every day that it is late.

Assignments will be graded by (1) how well you refer to the theories
learned in class to answer the question, and (2) how well you apply
those theories to the real world example. There is no page limit. Please
write as much as you need to answer the questions and reference the
relevant theories learned in class.

\hypertarget{quizzesin-class-assignments}{%
\subsection{Quizzes/In-class
Assignments}\label{quizzesin-class-assignments}}

You will take at least 10 quizzes in this course. Some quizzes will be
graded and others are for participation (each assignment will be clearly
marked whether it is graded or for participation). Quizzes and in-class
assignments may or may not be announced prior to the day they are given.
If more than 10 quizzes are given, only the 10 highest grades will
count.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Make-Up Exams:} I have a ``no questions asked'' early exam
  policy, which means that any exam can be taken early for any reason.
  However, only exams missed due to excused absences will be eligible
  for students to take at a later date. Students who are aware that they
  will miss an exam or have missed one due to an emergency are
  responsible for contacting the instructor to arrange a new exam date
  at least a week before the exam for planned occasions and in a timely
  manner for emergencies.
\item
  \textbf{Classroom Behavior:} Students should be respectful of others
  and refrain from behaving in a disruptive manner, including
  talking/texting on cell phone, speaking out of turn, reading non-class
  material, entering (leaving) class late (early), watching netflix,
  etc. When class permits itself to discussion, students should also be
  courteous to others opinions and backgrounds. Personal attacks or
  discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and/or
  lifestyle will not be tolerated. If a student fails to follow any of
  these behavior guidelines they will be asked to leave, and any
  persistent behavior can result in the removal of that student from the
  course.
\item
  \textbf{Incompletes:} Incompletes will be determined on an individual
  basis and generally will only be granted in extreme cases at the
  discretion of the instructor and in consultation with the Dean of
  Students/Dean of the College of Social Sciences. Please see me as soon
  as possible to determine the correct course of action to handle any
  major situations regarding this course and/or taking an incomplete.
\item
  \textbf{Cheating:} Cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated in
  this class. Any violation of the Academic Honor Policy will be
  referred to the Dean of Students and will result in a zero for the
  assignment or the course at my discretion.
\item
  \textbf{Assignment Review:} If you are concerned about your grade on
  an assignment, I am happy to review it. However, I require that you 1)
  wait 24 hours after the assignment has been returned to you to request
  review, and 2) outline your concerns about the assignment grade via
  email. Please be aware that I will regrade the entire assignment (not
  just one portion of it) if you request review, and I reserve the right
  to raise or lower your grade as a result.
\item
  \textbf{Extra Credit:} There will be no extra credit offered for this
  course.
\item
  \textbf{Email Policy:} Please include your first and last name and
  course information in the subject line of your email. When I receive
  your email, I will make every effort to respond in a timely manner,
  usually within 24 hours. Though you may receive a reply sooner than
  that, you should not expect an immediate response. Please treat all
  email correspondences with your instructor as you would treat any
  other professional exchange. Accordingly, I expect emails to be
  respectful and polite, to use correct grammar and complete sentences.
\item
  \textbf{Technology:} I can assure you, you will not find the answers
  to class discussion in your text, on facebook, twitter, or instagram.
  Cell phones and laptops are generally a distraction and detrimental to
  the classroom experience. They have the tendency to take students away
  from the lecture and impede the active engagement with students,
  instructors and/or peers. While I do permit the use of laptops and
  tablets for note-taking, I encourage you to leave your laptops at
  home, to take notes with a pen or a pencil and to engage in classroom
  discussions.

\subsection{University Attendance
Policy:}\label{university-attendance-policy}}

Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and
other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty,
religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences
will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize
students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to
students whose dependent children experience serious illness.

\hypertarget{americans-with-disabilities-act}{%
\subsection{Americans with Disabilities
Act:}\label{americans-with-disabilities-act}}

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodations should: (1)
register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability
Resource Center (SDRC); and (2) bring a letter to the instructor
indicating that you need academic accommodations and what type. This
should be done within the first week of class. This syllabus and other
class materials are available in alternative format upon request.
